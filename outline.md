# Hands-On Intro to Keras 

*Just enough Keras for students to put on their resume or use to supplement their capstone projects.*

## Act I - Intro to ANNs 

How ANNs function: Keras workflow, layers, representations

1. Anatomy and interaction of components
2. Interpretability, caution, and ethics
3. Just enough detail on how things work, not all the math or a deep dive on the history or cutting edge 

## Act II Neural Nets as a function approximation

- I do: Build and train a positive/negative number classifier.
- We do: Build an even/odd number classifier. Identify the components, explain how each piece works.
- You do: Build out FizzBuzz in Keras

## Act III - Working with Image Data

MNIST Digits, CIFAR10, and Fashion

- I do:  MNIST handwritten digit classifier
  - Connect to the big picture
  - Explore and visualize
- We do: CIFAR10 small images classifier
- You do: Fashion image classifier
