# Hands-On Intro to Keras 

*Enough Keras for students to put on their resume, use to supplement capstone projects, and provide starter scaffolding/kindling further study.*


## Act I - Intro to ANNs 

How ANNs function: Keras workflow, layers, representations

1. Concepts, Vocabulary, and Anatomy
2. Interpretability, caution, and ethics
3. Just enough detail on how things work, not all the math or a deep dive on the history or cutting edge 

## Act II Neural Nets as a function approximation

- I do: Build an even/odd number classifier. Identify the components, explain how each piece works.
- We do: Build out FizzBuzz in Keras

## Act III - Working with Image Data

MNIST Digits and Fashion datasets with a CNN

- I do:  MNIST handwritten digit classifier
  - Connect to the big picture
  - Explore and visualize
- You do: Fashion image classifier

## More Practice

- <https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_from_scratch/>
- CIFAR10 small images classifier
- Preprocessing resources. How to turn images/text/numbers into tensors/numpy arrays
- Further datasets for practice:
  - Classify movie review sentiment
  - House price predictor using regression
  - Classify newswire topics (multiclass)
